## Front End Libraries Projects - Build a Random Quote Machine

The user can generate a random quote by clicking on 'Generate random quote' button .The user can also tweet the quote.

This project is part of the Curriculum of Free code camp https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine. I've already done this project in the past (With pure vanilla JS), but i decided to do it a gain using React.  

In order to pass, i had to fullfill the following user-stories: 

User Story #1: I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id="quote-box".

User Story #2: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="text".

User Story #3: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="author".

User Story #4: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="new-quote".

User Story #5: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable a element with a corresponding id="tweet-quote".

User Story #6: On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id="text".

User Story #7: On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".

User Story #8: When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.

User Story #9: My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.

User Story #10: I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quotea element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in its href attribute to tweet the current quote.

User Story #11: The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
